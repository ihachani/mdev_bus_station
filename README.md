#Introduction
This application is a proof of concept created for Alesco Challenge.
The idea behind the application is to create a community driven transport network guide.
#Current Version
The current version is created using ionic2.
The app shows a list of stations at the time using google maps Api.
The app allows the user to add stations.
The data used in this version is a mock data stored in the app.
The service that provides the data uses promises. So switching to a webservice is easy to implement.
